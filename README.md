# Tic Tac Toe Browser Game

This is a tic tac toe browser game. It is written in javascript. The HTML/CSS is based on an old project (the Simon game).

Outstanding issues:

 - Minimax algorithm not working correctly - it just takes the first available square
 - Elements need to resize to fit screen, as zooming in/out will affect the board layout
 - Layout/design could be better, especially the scoreboard



# Files

This project contains three files.

## Index.html

Holds the overall layout of the board. There are two main divs, the board and the scoreboard.

## Styles.css

Stylesheet containing the button styles, colours, fonts etc.

## game.js
